Redmine Plugin - Auto Increment
=============================

Auto Increment is a [Redmine plugin](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins) which provides wiki macros for incrementing and decrementing a counter. By default the counter is incremented automatically with each macro call but can also be decremented or returned without modification.

The plugin is intended for use in wiki documents which include ordered lists (such as procedures) which are too large for the standard ordered list syntax (#).
